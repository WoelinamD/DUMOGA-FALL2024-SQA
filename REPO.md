1. Git hooks\
In workshop 8 Git hooks were introduced as a way to check for changes in C files using cppcheck. In workshop 6 bandit was used to identify security weaknesses in python files so I learned to implement these two things together to check for changes in
python files with git hooks. Any potential weaknesses are placed in weaknesses.csv\
